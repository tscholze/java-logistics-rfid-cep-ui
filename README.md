#Logistics 2.0 - Visualization of an event-processed RFID-Scanner

Using RFID tags and light barriers to capture arrival and exit of goods.

In this project with the combined force of students of the informatics and economic faculties a solution for  using RFID technology to asses logisics was created.

## The Team
The use of RFID for monitoring of processes promises to be a great asset for companies. However before an
implementation the technical feasibility and economic gain has to be considered. This was accomplished by our team members:

* Falk Alexander
* Tobias Scholze 
* Miriam Berschneider
* Felix Wagner
* Thomas Hipp
* Valon Berisha
* Michael Stadelmeier
* Manuel Feyrer
* Maximilian Schrupp
* Jennifer Meier

## Technologies
The system is based on a various, most Java-based technolgy stacks.

* Java (in general)
* Maven
* Apache Tapestry Web-Framework
* Hibernate OR-Mapper
* ESPER (Complex Event Processing)
* HornetQ (Java Message Service)
* and many more
